# CssOnly...
A collection of interactive components using nothing but html and css/scss, no javaScript.

## Purpose
I wanted to improve my development skills in building core website featured that do not require the use of javaScript. This is key when users opt into turning off javaScript in their browsers and so components such as these will continue to work as expected leading to the site still being operational.
