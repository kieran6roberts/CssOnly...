# CssOnly...
A collection of simple interactive front-end components using nothing but html and css/scss, no javaScript.

## Purpose
I wanted to improve my development skills in building core website featured that do not require the use of javaScript. This is key when users opt into turning off javaScript in their browsers and so components such as these will continue to work as expected leading to the site still being operational.

## Including
* Mobile hamburger navigation
* Navigation dropdown links
* Tooltip
* Popup modal

and more to come.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo to your machine and install dependencies.

To run in developemnt `yarn start`.  

To build for production `yarn build`.
